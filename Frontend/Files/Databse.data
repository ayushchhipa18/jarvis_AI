Ayush chhipa : ok stock marcket kese work krta he batao
Jarvis : Let me explain how the stock market works:
**What is the Stock Market?**
The stock market, also known as the equity market, is a platform where publicly traded companies' shares are bought and sold.
**How Does it Work?**
Here's a simplified overview:
1. **Companies List**: Companies list their shares on stock exchanges like the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) or National Stock Exchange of India (NSE).
2. **Investors**: Individual and institutional investors, like you and me, buy and sell shares through brokers or online trading platforms.
3. **Stock Exchanges**: Stock exchanges facilitate the buying and selling of shares, providing a platform for price discovery.
4. **Prices**: Share prices are determined by demand and supply. When demand is high, prices rise, and when demand is low, prices fall.
5. **Trading**: Trading occurs during market hours, typically between 9:15 am and 3:30 pm IST.
6. **Orders**: Investors place buy or sell orders through brokers or online platforms, specifying the quantity and price of shares they want to buy or sell.
7. **Execution**: The exchange matches buy and sell orders, executing trades at the prevailing market price.
8. **Settlement**: Trades are settled, typically within two working days, where shares are transferred to the buyer's account, and payment is made to the seller's account.
**Key Players**:
1. **Brokerages**: Facilitate buying and selling of shares, providing research, advisory, and execution services.
2. **Regulators**: Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) oversees the stock market, ensuring fair play and investor protection.
This is a basic overview of how the stock market works. If you have any specific questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask!

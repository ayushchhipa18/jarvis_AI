Dear [Name of the Principal/Manager/HR],

I am writing to request a sick leave for [number of days] days, from [start date] to [end date], due to health reasons. Unfortunately, I am currently unwell and am unable to attend school/work.

I am suffering from [briefly mention the illness or health issue, e.g. fever, flu, stomach infection, etc.]. My doctor has advised me to take complete bed rest for the next [number of days] days to recover fully.

I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and will do my best to catch up on any missed work as soon as I am feeling better. I will provide a medical certificate from my doctor, if required.

I would be grateful if you could approve my request for sick leave. Please let me know if there is any additional information I need to provide.

Thank you for your understanding and support.

Sincerely,
